# Rattlesnake W chromosome analysis

This repository contains details on the data processing and analysis steps used to assemble, annotate, and characterize the female-specific W chromosome, including comparative genomic analyses with other caenophidian snake and amniote species. This workflow is a companion to the methods described in Schield et al. (in review).

Shell and Python scripts are in `shell` and `python` directories, respectively. R scripts are in the `R` directory. Note that you may need to adjust the organization of path/file locations to suit your environment. This workflow assumes that you return to the main working directory after each major section.
